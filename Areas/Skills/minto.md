McKinsey employee Barbara Minto pioneering this writing and communication method
Structure for writing arguments in business setting, to persuade.
There are a couple different ways to apply it:
- Answer -> 3 supporting arguments -> 3 supporting facts or data with each argument
- How might we do x? -> Takeaways/solutions -> Evidence or reason Solution works -> Advice or the "how?"
Put the main solution at the top and in the front of the presentation or article.
