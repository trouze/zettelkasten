Instead of trying to use your technology and expertise to make a better product for your users' standard behavior, experiment with inviting the users to change their behavior to make the product work dramatically better.

Ideas that spread, win. Each market needs _sneezers,_ people who are key spreading agents of an idea. They need the authority to spread your idea.

Break into a niche to start. Create an ideavirus so focused that it overwhelms the small slice of the market that really and truly will respond to you. With a few sneezers, you can hope to access the mainstream, but you cannot market directly to the mainstream as it just doesn't work anymore due to attention being such a scarce resource.

Things to ask yourself when starting something new:

- How smooth and easy is it to spread your idea?
- How often will people sneeze it to their friends?
- How tightly knit is the group you're tar
- How reputable are the people most likely to promote your idea?
- How persistent is it - is it a fad that has to spread fast before it dies, or will the idea have legs (and thus you can invest in spreading it over time)?

We've reached a point where marketing needs to be hypertargeted. Find the sneezers. Be aware of your marketing opportunities. Good chances don't come often, so invest your extra cash in the product itself, and when the right opportunity comes along take it. You must develop products that people will seek out.

Differentiate your customers. Find the group that's most profitable. Find the group that's the most likely to sneeze. Figure out how to develop/advertise/reward either group. Ignore the rest. Your adds and products shouldn't cater to the masses. Your adds and products should cater to the customers you'd choose if you could choose your customers.

Consumers are getting better and better at ignoring mass media, and because of this mass media stops working.

Make a list of competitors who are not trying to be everything to everyone. Are they outperforming you? If you could pick one underserved niche to target (and to dominate), what would it be? Why not launch a product to compete with your own - a product that does nothing but appeal to this market?

We've been raised in a false belief: we mistakenly believe that criticism leads to failure. From the time we get to school, we're taught that being noticed is almost always bad. The only way to be remarkable is to set yourself up for criticism. Playing it safe is _risky._ Criticism of the project is _not_ criticism of you. You do not equal the project.

Make a list of ways you can catch up by being different.

"If you measure it, it will improve."

Once you've tasted success. Don't try to prove you can strike gold again with the same product, but sell to the converted. Then you're not trying to interrupt strangers. Your audience will be delighted, and then they will indoctrinate their friends. Thus, your market/universe grows. Big fans bring in new fans, and old fans stick around because they're catered to. There's very little leakage because the band keeps the existing customer base satisfied with remarkable products.

Smart businesses market products to markets where there are people who are curious and will learn about their product.

Find the market niche first, then a remarkable product.

Focus on market-centric design that builds the very success of the product's marketing into the product itself.

If you're not passionate and curious to learn every detail about the market, design, and specifications of your product, then you'll find yourself asking "how do I know if my product is remarkable?" If you don't know your product well enough, then you're not curious enough to learn all of its ins and outs. When the surf is up near the Patagonia offices, they get empty real fast. This makes for a chaotic work environment, but it's much more likely that the Patagonia staff will know a remarkable outdoor product when they see one.

When GM shows a concept car at an auto show, they are trying to figure out what the people think is remarkable. Not focus groups per se, but cheap prototypes that you show in very public releases.

The path to lifetime job security is to be remarkable. Take high profile projects
