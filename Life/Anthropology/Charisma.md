Charisma is body language, that’s basically it. But body language manifests itself based on the thoughts within your head. If you can control those thoughts to give you the best qualities of charisma, it will show in body language, and you will be charismatic.

Immediate ways to improve charisma

- Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of sentences
    
- Reduce how quickly and how often you nod
    
- Pause a full two seconds before you speak
    
- Be present, actually listen.
    
    Presence, Power, and Warmth
    
- Be attentive, be present, not thinking about something else or what you’ll say next.
    
- Power and warmth: Power is our ability to affect the world around us, while warmth is goodwill towards others. We want both.
    

**Overcoming Obstacles**

Step 1: Destigmatize the experience, Destigmatize Discomfort

- Don’t feel bad about feeling bad, which humans commonly do.
- Shame is a natural response to humans not being socially accepted, this response comes from the days when it was life or death if the tribe didn’t accept you.
- Putting it into practice:
    - Remember that uncomfortable emotions are normal, natural, and simply a legacy of our survival instincts. We all experience them from time to time.
    - Dedramatize: this is a common part of human experience that happens every day
    - Think of others who’ve gone through this before, especially people you admire

Step 2: Neutralize Negativity

- One of the main reasons we are so affected by negative thoughts is that we think our mind has an accurate grasp on reality, and that its conclusions are generally valid. This is a fallacy. Our mind’s view of reality can be, and often is, completely distorted.
- We tend to focus on the negative, even in a positive situation. Remind yourself that you may not be getting the entirely accurate perception of reality.
- Neutralize, don’t argue or try to suppress a negative thought, fully experience it instead. This will only make it even more central to your thoughts, doing the opposite of what we wish to accomplish.

Step 3: Rewrite Reality

- Rewrite your perception of reality. Instead of suppressing or ignoring emotions, change your belief about what happened. That person who was really short with you? They were having a bad day due to something unrelated to you. In most situations, we don’t know what the motivation was, so we might as well choose something that serves you, not hurts you.
    
- Delve into sensations. Focus on the minute sensations and signals your body/mind is producing, not on trying to get rid of them. Be comfortable with discomfort, feel those feelings. You’ll be fully present and your mind will have something to focus on that isn’t a negative thought etc.
    
    Creating Charismatic Mental States
    

Visualize

- Use visualization. Envision yourself actually doing something that makes you feel powerful, confident, any feeling really. This will activate parts of the brain such that you feel like you are actually doing it. Will help you get into the right charismatic mental state.
- Certain movements or postures can bring up specific emotions in your mind

Gratitude

- Gratitude will put you in a state of warmth. Focus on little things in front of you. It will bring you to the present and push your body language to emanate warmth.
- Imagining your funeral can be a very powerful experience. It can show your values, insights on yourself, but also put you in a state of gratitude for the remainder of your life.

Goodwill and Compassion

- When you focus on someone’s well-being, it will show. It takes away the striving, struggling, pushing for things to go in a certain direction, and people will notice this. You’ll find you’re less concerned on how the interaction goes, you’re not trying to ‘get’ something out of it.
- Goodwill means you wish someone well without knowing how they’re feeling. Empathy means you understand how they feel, and perhaps you’ve had a similar experience. Compassion is empathy plus goodwill: you understand how they feel and you wish them well.
- Put yourself in other people’s shoes.

Self-compassion

- Focus on self-compassion more than self-esteem. Self-esteem is more of a roller coaster, and it tends to correlate with narcissism.
- Self-compassion is how much warmth we have for ourselves, even when we’re going through a tough time.
- Self-compassion is not self-pity. It’s about feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, while pity is feeling that it’s unfair.
- Answers the question of how do you care for yourself when you’re having a hard time? Understand you’re having difficulties, respond with kindness toward yourself, and realize whatever is going on is commonly experienced across the world.
- Practice metta

Using body to affect mind

- Displaying confident body language has been shown to release a chemical in the brain that makes you more confident.
    
- Your brain doesn’t know the difference between imagination and reality – it has the same physiological reaction to both
    
    Charisma Types
    
- Focus: Presence and Confidence
    
- Visionary: Belief and Confidence
    
- Kindness: Warmth and Confidence
    
- Authority: Status, Confidence, Appearance, and Clothing
    
    - Facial Expressions/Body Language are important

First Impressions:

- Match the way you look to who you’re meeting
- Have a firm handshake, straight up and down.
- Breaking the ice:
    - Ask about their story, this has a positive emotional effect
    - Content of what you say doesn’t matter, how they feel is more important because how people feel is how what they will remember.
    - Focus on positive topics, if you discuss negative things they may associate you will their negative feelings.
    - Speak their language – I think you’re really good at this already. If they’re a golfer, say “on par”. Additionally, just match how they talk.
    - Match their body language

Letting people impress you

- Listening
    
    - Never interrupt, let others interrupt you.
    - Pause two seconds before answering. Let your body language and facial expressions absorb, react, and then respond.
- Speaking
    
    - Associate yourself with positive topics
- Compliment taking
    
    - Stop. Absorb compliment like you’ve never heard it before. Show it on your face. Show them they’ve had an impact. Tell them it made your day, don’t make them feel like they shouldn’t have ever given the compliment like they would if you were to brush it off.
- Be graphic when speaking – speak in images using descriptive words.
    
- Deliver High Value
    
    - Attention and time are precious resources for people so make it worthwhile.
    - Give them something entertaining, informative, or something that will elicit good feelings.
- Voice
    
    - Power: lower tone, projected like an arrow, slow tempo with frequent pauses. Pausing makes you seem more confident.
    - Warmth: Simply smile
    - Fluctuate your voice: Pitch, tempo, volume, tone, rhythm
- Body language
    
    - Mirroring body language makes others like you more
- In negative situations:
    
    - Mirror then lead your body language to get their mirror oscillators to start going. Mirror only when listening, lead more positively when you’re speaking.
- Keep eye contact
    
- Posture
    
    - Take up space, breath deeply, don’t fidget, no “ums”, few “uh-huhs” and assurances, few nods
- Remember: Non-verbal communication speaks to others emotional mind. Words to logical brain
    
    Ben Franklin Effect
    #benfranklin
- When someone dislikes you, ask them for a favor. If they go through with it, they either consider themselves inconsistent or will rationalize the action by deciding they like you.
    
    - Choose favors that are low cost – like their opinion. Thank them profusely for it, be specific, say “you”, and they’ll feel invested in your success.

Dealing with people

- Show people the impact they’ve had on you or an idea, and they’ll feel inclined to support.
- With difficult people, get into a state of empathy
- Don’t create negative associate with others
- Don’t say things like “you shouldn’t find it insulting” or similar. People focus on insulting, not shouldn’t. The negative words will have the greatest affect.

Delivering Criticism

- Be specific, focus on facts of behavior, not the person.
- Depersonalize. Have a mindset of empathy, discuss the way you yourself feels – don’t focus on them. Not “you suck” but “I get stressed out when..”
- Delivery. Express the worth you see in them. Then discuss the issue. Tell them the change you want to see. Don’t say things like “don’t do…”
- Avoid making people feel wrong, in an effort to justify they may try to discredit you.
- Finish with a positive – appreciation, vision, next steps

Apologies

- Listen, don’t interrupt, state of “help me understand how you see things”
- Actually apologize. Body language and facial expressions matter most. Then discuss what steps you’ll take to make sure it won’t happen again.
- Mistakes and Apologies can truly be a positive thing because most people suck at them, so if you can deliver a sincere one you may jump miles ahead of others who never made the mistake in the first place.

Emails

- Less communication dimensions.
- Speak to them, say the word “you”
- Trim emails to where there is nothing you can subtract from it anymore, less stuff for people to fill in the blanks. That is a perfect email.

Presentations

- Pause at beginning of speech
- Keep it simple. People will have attention on other things, so have one main message and 3-5 supporting points
- Humans think in 3s, supporting points should be anecdotes, facts, statistics, metaphor/analogies.
- Stories. Make them relatable and entertaining.
- Metaphors/analogies. Example: Searching for untapped potential in customer base – refer to team as “bounty hunters”
- Statistics. Make personal and meaningful. Sold 10,000 becomes we sold 10 per hour.
- Do Q&A during a speech. We want to start and end on a high note since that is what people will remember. Q&A will always lower energy at the end. Having it during the speech will keep audience engaged. #speaking
- Clothing choices
    - Red: Energy, passion, wakes up audience
    - Black: Serious, won’t take no for an answer
    - White: Honesty and innocence
    - Blue: Trust. The deeper the blue, the more trust.
    - Gray: Neutral
    - No orange or yellow
- When practicing, go through the presentation with eyes closed.
- Projecting power: Wide stance, move comfortably around stage – own it! Find right volume
- Spend 1-2 seconds of eye contact per person, start with people smiling and engaged.
- Voice fluctuation key, smile for warmth, drop tone for confidence/authority
- After delivering key or dramatic points, pause for effect.
- Don’t run off stage after finishing. Pause. Say thank you. Sit in applause.
- When a mistake is made: Rewrite your reality, think “good speakers make mistakes to seem more relatable” which is true, Sam Walton would drop his papers and Frank Sinatra would do something similarly embarrassing.
- Make speech about audience, don’t think about yourself when speaking. Wondering how they’re doing will put you in a state of goodwill.
- Expect things to go wrong
- Speak as if you’re sharing a secret

In Crisis

- Those who respond boldly and decisively will be perceived as charismatic. Stay calm – destigmatize and dedramatize.
- Assign and express high expectation of people to live up to in these situations. Direct them with lofty goals, tell them how positively you view them, tell them their worth.
- AFTER: Articulate a vision to hold on to charisma gained during crisis when crisis is over, otherwise you will be forgotten about. George HW was highly rated during Gulf War, but afterwards he didn’t have a vision so people disapproved eventually.
