Todd Herman is a sports psychologist who focuses on getting the most out of your impact moments on the field of play. He argues that all great leaders, athletes, and performers have the ability to channel a different personality that allows them to enter in to an extraordinary world.

When you were a child, before there was imposter syndrome and anxiety, you pretended to be a superhero in the backyard. Todd suggests that we can slip in to an alter ego that embodies the characteristics of who we want to become.

To be clear, this is not "faking it until you make it". At all. This hits somewhere in between that and choosing to entirely change the "wiring" of your brain. Some argue that going back to the problems of your past (all insecurities and things that hold us back usually stem from something in the past) just allows those neurons to strengthen, further keeping you from changing who you are to a better version. Faking it until you make it lacks any sort of framework, and is usually focused on a specific trait with no plan to achieve that trait. The alter ego effect is a well defined ego that you create, with characteristics, a defined time and place in which you "become" that ego, and tools that help you slip you in to this ego.

Marilyn Monroe was someone who notably had an alter ego, after walking through Grand Central Terminal without being noticed, once outside she asked photographers if they "wanted to see her" (referring to her alter ego), suddenly she was surrounded by a group of people.

## Appendix: Notes from reading

- Name your enemy, when negative self talk begins, talk back to this persona- give it a name. Make it someone who will motivate you more when the chatter starts. Giving this negative self talk an identity helps you identify it, and also fight back against it.
- You act out the story you tell yourself everyday, the alter ego is about slipping in to a different story for a while that isn't yours.
- We must all suffer one of two pains:
    - Pain of discipline
    - Pain of regret
- Risk the unusual, or settle for the ordinary
- Many chose a path out of fear disguised as practicality
- You can fail at what you don't want to do, so you might as well fail at what you do want.
- Don't let your mind go to an ordinary place when you need to perform, that's when you lose.
- Negative self talk has been shown to go away when we're engaged in creative work/activites
- Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose.
- What - bigger than yourself - are you fighting for?
- 4 core motivators:
    1. Trauma: Self explanatory, you've felt some pain and you want to avenge it
    2. Destiny: Feeling of "chosen one" is usually described by people who are called by this
    3. Altruism: Serving others who you feel are slighted, helpless
    4. Self-expression: Challenging yourself with "I wonder what I can do/create/find"
- Core Drivers:
    - Family
    - Community
    - Nation (common in olympic athletes)
    - Religion
    - Race
    - Gender
    - Identifiable group, idea, or cause
- What makes you feel the most? It usually starts out with above but morphs itself into a deeper meaning in one of the core drivers.
- Ask yourself questions in third person to avoid self-reflection paradox
- Build your alter ego on traits, or on role model, animal etc. Choose something that emotionally resonates with you. Give the ego a name.
- Give your ego a backstory: what does it wear, what's its background, values, beliefs.
- Build an origin story, create emotional context
- Use an artifact or object that allows you to put/turn on your alter ego. Turn it on during moments of impact only.
- Ground punch: A response proclamation. When you're on the field of play and your alter ego starts slipping to negative self talk - ask who do you think you are? Get angry, have a positive story and go for it.
