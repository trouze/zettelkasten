Phase 1: Precycle
- Start movement around a weird thing, with no hope of payoff.
Phase 2: Growth
- Grows forward (more of thing), upward (infra, conferences, newsletters), outward.
- Outward is interesting because subcultures resemble Ponzi schemes in this way. If you've been in a subculture the longest, you theoretically have a higher status than everyone who's joined after you.
- Key to this phase is that there is no incentive to compete with any other member yet since the frontier is so vast.
Phase 3: Involution/stagflation
- During this phase, a talented status-hungry young person who joins the movement is likely to expect status but not get it. The only source of status is to seize someone else's - ie to start a fight.
Phase 4: Postcycle
- People realize you can't get status from subculture anymore (or at least not very quickly). Movement stabilizes in a low growth state.
- Governance is in place, which is hard to affect. You can't walk in a argue that you should be a black belt and the master should defer to you.
