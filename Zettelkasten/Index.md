Hub of key concepts
Each Zettel is:
- Atomic (one idea per note)
- Written in my own words
- Links to related concepts (which is what makes Obsidian great!)
- Goal is to grow into a web of thoughts, not a folder of files

My workflow:
1. Capture ideas on paper
2. Transfer them to Inbox, still not worrying about formatting
3. Weekly, go through inbox and convert to Zettels
	1. Use the timestamp method (timestamp + idea name)
4. Update [[Index]] for high-value ideas
5. Tag and backlink to relevant Areas/ pages
