- Lead with your mind, anyone can come up with a vision, the key is holding that vision.
- Building a business is an act of faith, turning nothing into something
- Keep seeing in your mind’s eye where it is that you are going, especially when nobody else does
- Never forget where you came from
- Apply your belief in people, and they will meet or exceed your expectations
- Respond, don’t react
- Don’t react and assume that you are right, but rather make your request to what will make you happy, let the other person still be right
- Give people something great to live up to
- Influence is to pull, not push
- Great leaders don’t expect anyone else to do anything they haven’t done themselves, spend time doing the work yourself before you can lead and influence others to do the same
- You can only be genuinely humble if you have enormous self-respect
- Respect from other is a reflection, not the source, respect yourself first, trust yourself
- Do the work, don’t worry so much about the outcome
- What you give, you off least of all through what you say in greater part through what you do, but in greatest part through who you are
- You can lead only as far as you grow, and you grow only as far as you let yourself
- The more you give away, the more you have

1. Hold the vision
2. Build your people
3. Do the work
4. Stand for something
5. Practice giving leadership

- Great leadership is never about the leader, it’s about holding people up
- The best way to increase your influence is to give it away
- Practice seeing and bringing out greatness in other
- Together/united we succeed, divided we fall

A question to ponder: What are some things that you only have because you gave away first?
