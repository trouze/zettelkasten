- The market is essentially the culmination of perception of how we feel about a stock or equity
    1. Perception is based on context, and what context is relevant
    2. Perception can be manipulated and influence what we think we see
- Even the visual cortex needs emotion to be able to see, we link emotion to certain objects, whether we know it or not
- About reading the numbers to understand the market’s perception. How?
- Captain Kirk vs. Spock: Spock has been able to think purely on a logical scale while Kirk still thinks with feeling and emotion, yet who do they always turn to when the toughest decisions are to be made?
- Trade for confidence (you should feel it), trade for momentum
- Emotions don’t automatically mean action
- Trade not by looking for what everyone else doesn’t know but search for what others are about to know. Trade on the near-term general opinion of a stock.
- You are only betting on whether or not someone will pay a different price for the stock that you did.
- Understand what came before, how that was perceived, and what the general explanation for it is.
- Creating Psychological Leverage
    1. Create physical energy
    2. Read other people
    3. Get the risk management edge through knowing yourself and how you feel (you emotional contexts) operating at any given moment
    4. Get the strategy edge by using that knowledge of yourself to understand others (their emotional contexts), which they most likely will act out (since they aren’t doing #3)
    5. Know when to push it because you have emotional capital and psychological leverage
    6. Know when not to push it because you are acting out of an emotional context fueled by the past, be it the immediate past or the distant fractal past
- Be patient (look back at #3), don’t enter the market when nothing is going on and no one knows what to do. Read people and get a feeling for when the next wave is coming and ride it. It is never about “dollars per day” because some days there just isn’t dollars to be made, be patient.
- Call back on you past to understand what underlying fractals are creating your future results. Don’t think you deserve to be right? Anchor something that proves this belief wrong on your next trade.
- Use number, news, and data to formulate how you believe people will perceive a company/market. Numbers alone will fail you. Tap into your market intuition about people.
- We act out when the uncertainty is too great and we imagine/anticipate the pain, not so much act out when the pain is too great.
