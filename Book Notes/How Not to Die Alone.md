Intention-action gap is what behavioral science calls when we intend to do something but don’t take steps to make it happen. One at a time.

Hesitaters delay dating because they don’t feel 100% ready, but the truth is no one ever feels 100% ready for anything. At some point you have to leap.

Make a deadline

Prep

Commit to the new identity

Start small and set specific goals

Be compassionate with yourself
