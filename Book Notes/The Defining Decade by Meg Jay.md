**Work**

- Build your identity capital, have a story to build upon that says who you are, helps in job interviews
- There is strength in your weak ties
- You are who you hang out with, you think like who you hang out with, choose accordingly, seeking out new people can not only enhance your life but also introduce you to knew thoughts and ideas
- Don’t accept underemployment, do things that during this time that can go on a resume and make for a good story to the interviewer (volunteerism, commitment to it)
- Saying yes means you will do something new, meet someone new, and make a difference
- What you put out into the world will come back for you, talk about that position you want to not only your friends but your weak ties
- Be decisive, even if you are unsure, everything happens for you, and no path is straight
- Focus on the task at hand, not how to make it to the next level all the time
- Pick your pieces of identity, build them into something custom, something only you can be

**Love**

- Don’t spend twenties with low-criteria people when it comes to relationships, this won’t get you anywhere
- Marrying can be like picking a second family
- Don’t cohabitate unless you are serious about it, not just because it’s easy or makes sense
- Don’t date down just to feel wanted
- Couples with similar personalities tend to have more successful relationships, google “the big five” it’s a good check to see if someone is a good fit
- Just because someone passes basic criteria (age, religion, looks) doesn’t mean it is a match

**The Brain and Body**

- Focus on differences that might matter in 10 years, not on differences that more wants than needs
- Twenties are years of rapid development of the frontal lobe, emotions, you should use this time wisely. Have new experiences, shape who you wish to become, now is the best time to learn these things because it only gets harder later on
- Frontal lobe is about forward-thinking, as well as handling outside judgement and criticism
- Calm yourself, Meg Jay says, twentysomethings will feel inadequate during these years because their frontal lobe isn’t completely developed to handle outside judgement, so we may feel we are underperforming at our jobs, stick with it
- The art of being wise is knowing what to overlook
- Understand that these years may feel like you’re only as good as the last thing that happened
- Use your frontal lobe, control how you interpret and react to a situation, be factual about the situations
- Inaction bread fear and doubt. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.
- Have a growth mindset. When things become difficult, get resilient, realize that you can grow and change who you are.
- Twentysomethings who push themselves to have more responsibility will be happier
- Most people regret not having serious relationships during their twenties
- Be ruled by time, the wisest counselor of all
- Write out what your happy ending looks like, so you can work toward it
- time is limited, don’t look at it with a psychological disconnect of “I have time” when you really don’t, write out a timeline so you can see what you’re dealing with
- When you ask yourself, “am I going to make it?”, answer “you haven’t decided yet.” Live intentionally.
