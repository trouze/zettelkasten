- People love to tell you what you should and shouldn’t do
    - Humans are so malleable that, if you listen to others long enough, you’ll tell yourself that what they’re saying is true
    - You can stay stuck with those non-truths because you’d rather not upset or disappoint anybody
- We are what we repeatedly do
- Do more things that make you feel happy, become aware of them and do them
- Have faith in the universe
- Give in abundance and in any way, then you shall receive
- Meditate, control your own mind in thinking happy, uplifting thoughts
- Confidence, fake it until you make it, start with your body language
- Decide and go for something with all out conviction
- Don’t live your life wearing the victim goggles, everything happens for you, not to you, look forward to what a situation may bring you and look for a lesson in everything
- Give yourself tastes of what you want someday, travel somewhere and look at things you hope to experience
- You can do it! Believe in yourself, ordinary people do it every day, you are extraordinary and deserve to have all the money you need to live a free and fulfilling life
- Don’t make money out to be something greedy or bad, it’s freedom and once you have it you can affect things in positive ways. Start giving in small ways now and soon enough you’ll be giving big
- Surround yourself with those who are likeminded, supportive of your path, perhaps further along than you are, with things/places that inspire you to grow and achieve, Jen moved to the west side of LA in a small place just to give her a taste
- If you’re not uncomfortable you’re not growing
- Develop your “Why” or “Whys” and the emotion around it, visualize or get a taste of these “whys”
- Be tenacious, this means keeping faith much longer than the average person
- Create a buddy system for new habits. Ex. Play a theme song every time you’re going to take a leap and od something scary
- Read a biography of someone you aspire to be
- Events seem very large in the present, but once you’ve grown you realize they weren’t really that big after all
