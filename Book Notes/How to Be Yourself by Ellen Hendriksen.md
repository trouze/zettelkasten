- Question your inner critic on the things it tries to tell you. Pin down your inner critic's worst case scenarios.
- Practice mindfulness, enter into the present with countdown from 5, realize your thoughts are like watching a movie, not the reality.
- Ask yourself how you'll cope with your worst case scenario.
- Social anxiety is something that happens rather than something that defines you
- Social situations are easier when you have structure/framework to how you go about them, defining a purpose. Operating within constraints is oddly freeing because at least there is direction there.
    - This note goes for just about anything, a blank slate is great, but it must be given some rules, strategies, frameworks, constraints before you actually take any action.
    - You can be the center of attention without being yourself.
- When you're about to do something anxiety inducing, re-affirm yourself with things you truly believe about yourself, even if the affirmation has nothing to do with what you're about to do- which will likely be the case
- You set the tone, setting it energetically & positively will always lead to better outcomes
- Spending your energy on not doing anxiety safety measures will make people more comfortable around you
- Remind yourself of time you were your best and your best will show up.
- People are apt to help, stop rejecting yourself for fear of rejections and you'll see
- Best predictor for making friends? Repetition, i.e. seeing someone often
    - Join clubs, groups, etc. and just show up. Lore has it you need to have 6-8 interactions before considering someone a friend.
    - Once you've been a part of something for long enough (at least 3-4 months), take on a role of leadership so conversations aren't forced any longer- gives you a set of duties and forces interaction upon yourself.
