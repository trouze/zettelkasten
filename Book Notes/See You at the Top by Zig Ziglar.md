- The corporate executive who alienated his family in his quest to the top is not a success. He can’t take it with him and to whom is he going to leave it?
- You must take all the steps to achieve success, don’t cut corners otherwise it won’t truly be success and you will see it.
- No one was “born” anything. It takes hard, focused effort to become something, but it most certainly can be done with the right mindset and the right information.
- You steal from yourself when you try to steal from others, whether you know it or not.
- Think about walking a foot-wide plank on the floor, you see yourself making the walk easily. Now think about walking a foot-wide plank between two 10 story buildings, you see yourself falling. In order to succeed you must visualize the positive.
- Change your self-image. If you don’t, you will end up in the scrap heap of “what could have been.” At some point, you must step in the box and take a swing.
- You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help enough other people get what they want. If you serve more, you earn more.
- Be a “good finder”, look for good in others- it’s a good business and humanness decision. You treat people exactly as you see them, so find good and the rest will follow. Bring out the best in people.
- Help others reveal the wealth in themselves. Give them something to live up to.
- You have everything you want in life, you just have to help enough people to get there.
