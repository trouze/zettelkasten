It’s not goals that lead to results, but the systems that underpin those goals and generate the results. Focus on your systems rather than goals. Furthermore, satisfaction can be obtained from having a running system, rather than the dissatisfaction of a goal not yet obtained. Goal setting is short minded, once you’ve achieved the goal the training stops. This is what we want. 

You do not rise to the level of your goals, but rather fall to the level of your systems. 

Base goals via identity driven. The goal isn’t to do something, but to become something. If you believe in a particular aspect of your identity, you’re more likely to act congruently to it. 

For your goals, ask who is the type of person who could achieve this goal?
