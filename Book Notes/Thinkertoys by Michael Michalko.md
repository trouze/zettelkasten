Thinkertoys is a book (erm a manual really) on creative thinking. I spent way too much time left-brain thinking in college and I'm all out of wack.

A thinkertoy is essentially a technique to get you to consider an idea in a different way.

### Tick Tock

For getting out of negative thinking. It's no secret we can use positive thinking to help us reframe and relieve pressure on the task at hand. 

1. Zero in on and write down negative thoughts that are preventing you from realizing your goal. Write them under "tick".
2. Sit quietly and examine the negatives. Learn how you are irrationally twisting things and blowing them out of proportion.
3. Substitute an objective, positive thought for each subjective, negative one. Write these under "tock".

Simply spinning your original beliefs can help get creativity flowing. There was a study done on two departments of a publishing company, one the CEO saw as not being creative and the other as having good creativity. Psychologists found the only common difference between the two groups was that one believes that they are creative and one does not.

### Mind Pumping

If you act like an idea person, you'll become an idea person.

Give yourself an idea quota, everyday. It will force you to actively generate ideas.

Many of us look, but do not see. Get tone in your life, meaning pay attention to what is around you.

### Routine/Habits

Habits, while good (or bad) in some circumstances, can limit you quite a lot. Doing new things can open new horizons, taking a different route to work, changing your sleep hours, change your working hours, listen to a new music genre, read a different news source are all ideas of avoiding lock in. This can bring new ideas and inspiration as opposed to the mundane.

### Feeding your head

Creative thinkers feed their minds new information and ideas.

Select carefully, be purposeful about what you're reading. Take notes, outline the book before you read it as to what you think you'll learn.

Read biographies, there are a ton of ideas contained in these. Read how-to books.

### Capturing Ideas

Founder of NCR used to force his executives to carry a little notebook to record daily activities, thoughts, and ideas. Eventually, a sixth of major US companies in 1910-1930 were headed by ex-NCR employees, including Tom Watson founder of IBM.

### Challenges

List your business problems down in writing. Your mind is constantly shifting what it is focusing on, so writing things down can help you determine what you should focus on. 

Create a bug list, what bugs/annoys you? Then choose what to focus on that is worth solving. Thomas Edison once said that he didn't have the time, energy, or interest to modify the world to fit his inventions.

A problem well defined is a problem half solved. The more time you devote to perfecting the wording your challenge, the closer you will be to solution.

Vary the words. Use synonyms or substitutes for key words in the challenge statement. "How can I get to the second string" vs. "In what ways might the string and I get together?"

Stretching the challenge: 5 whys. This will help you identify the general objective and allow you to challenge your assumptions. The shipping industry tried to make ships more economical at sea and while in transit from one port to another. Costs continued to rise even though they reduced crew, used less fuel. A ship is capital equipment, and the biggest cost for the equipment is the cost of *not working.* Instead a consultant asked: "In what ways might the shipping industry reduce costs?" This allowed them to consider all aspects of the shipping process, finding that the loading and unloading was the most time consuming part, thus the shipping container was born so loading could happen on land. Freighter traffic increased fivefold while costs have fallen 60 percent in the last 30 years.

Squeezing the challenge: To ascertain a a challenge's strengths, weaknesses, and boundaries, ask who, what, where, when, why, and how. How else? What else? Squeeze more out of the challenge to create subproblems that are simpler to solve.

### False Facts

Reversal. Finding ideas by reversing the conventional assumptions. Henry Ford stopped bringing people to the work, and started brining the work to the people with the assembly line.

1. State your challenge
2. List your assumptions
3. Challenge your fundamental assumptions
4. Reverse each assumption. Write down the opposite of each one
5. Record differing viewpoints that might prove useful to you
6. Ask yourself how to accomplish each reversal. List as many useful viewpoints and ideas as you can

An example with starting a restaurant

- Some common assumptions about restaurants are:
    - Restaurants have menus
    - Restaurants charge money for food
    - Restaurants serve food
- Reverse each assumption
    - Restaurants have no menus of any kind
    - Restaurants give food away for free
    - Restaurants do not serve food of any kind
- Ask yourself how to accomplish each reversal
    - A restaurant with no menu
        - Idea: The chef informs each customer what he bought that day at the market and asks the customer to select items that he or she finds appealing and creates a dish with those items.
    - A restaurant that gives away food
        - Idea: An outdoor cafe where customers pay for time instead of food. Use a time stampe and charge by the minute
    - A restaurant that does not serve food
        - Idea: Create a restaurant with a unique decor in an exotic environment and rent out the location. People bring their own food and beverages and pay a service charge for the location.
    - Select one and build it into a real idea.

A story about monkeys (paraphrased): Five monkeys in a cage, banana hanging on a string with stairs leading to it. When a monkey tries to go for the banana all monkeys are sprayed with cold water. Eventually monkeys will stop others from trying. Now turn off the cold water. Take a monkey out of the cage and replace it with a new one and the new one will try the stairs but will be stopped from trying thinking they'll all get sprayed. Replace another and the same will happen, until eventually the cage is all monkeys who haven't been sprayed but won't go up the stairs because it is all they've known. Challenge all assumptions!
