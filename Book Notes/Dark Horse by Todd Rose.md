Dark Horse aims to spread the idea that your personal motivators, interests, and everything that makes you unique are the best drivers for creating your own success. We live in a world where everything has become standardized for efficiency. While this has helped pull millions of people out of poverty and create better lives for all, we also remove the individuality of the human and work becomes a series of monotonous tasks. Dark Horse argues that we can use the things that make us "click", the minute parts of our personality, to drive us to a happy career where we are fulfilled. For example, some really love to organize, while this may not seem like a lucrative career, there are people who literally organize executives lives and give them tools to better manage their day to day life as well as reorganizing their home. If we are itching the personality traits of our own that make us the most motivated to move, then we are living the Dark Horse mentality. 

Todd Rose argues that we should break the societal mold that says we should all be a cog in the machine and never tap in to those micro-motives that drive us for the name of greater efficiency in production. He believes that setting a final destination where you've "made it" is a surefire path to eternal unhappiness. Ignoring the destination and enjoying the day to day is the best path forward. If your current job has you longing for the next step on the ladder, you're not doing something that allows you to use your micro-motivators. Many follow the path of making more money, getting an MBA so they can give presentations. What energizes you?  It may not be what you think of as a lucrative career, but usually if it drives you from deep in your core, you'll find a way to make it so.

## Finding your Micro-motives

What things are you attracted to the most? Objects? Activities? What are the characteristics or skills you are using when you perform those activities?

Judge people. When you see a businessman working, watch and judge what they're doing. Consider how you'd like to do what their doing, and sometimes more importantly, what you wouldn't like doing that they are. Ultimately we're chasing a feeling when we're working on our calling, if you're fulfilling your micro desires you're doing things right. What would you love about a job? What wouldn't you? What jobs exist (or don't) that allow you to achieve that feeling of your most deepest desire. Judge another's career and ask yourself what you would and wouldn't like doing that they are.

## Know your Strategies

The standardization covenant calls for everyone to learn the same thing, and learn it in largely the same way, and then get tested on it in the same way. What I consider to be a gross grievance against the american citizens is the abhorrent lack of understanding in how different each human is in the way they learn. Knowing your strategies calls for going about achievement of a goal in a way that is unique to you, but is based in an understanding of yourself and how you learn and perform/execute. Ask yourself, is the right strategy for me?

### Destination vs. goals

Grand master chess players don't play with the destination in mind, they make the next move that maximizes the probability of achieving their goal of winning (this is how the computer deep blue plays). There isn't a large grand plan that is grounded in playing an entire strategy in hopes your opponent falls into it so you win. 

Ignore destinations, but not goals. A goal emerges out of your individuality. Born out of an active choice you've made. The standardization covenant calls for the idea of time being the marker of whether you'll be successful. Have you ever heard of the 10,000 hour rule? This is merely a rule of thumb, but one that lacks any context or understanding of your individual talents and strategies. We've long tried to standardize how long it takes to do something, 4 years for a bachelor degree etc., but now we should advocate for focusing on the strategies unique to oneself to achieve success/goals faster. It's quite possible that for you, 10,000 hours would be a long amount of time to achieve your goal. Have you ever wondered if you're trying to force something, like pushing a squared peg through a round hole? Maybe you're just not good at something, or more likely, you're not going about achievement of this specific goal in the most optimal way for yourself. 

### Pursuit of Excellence

Your pursuit of excellence can be thought of as your own personal global optimization problem. You solve thru gradient ascent. The algorithm works as such:

1. Look around and determine which slope is the steepest
2. Follow the slope to a vantage point and then repeat

It may not get you there the fastest, there's no guarantee of that whatsoever, but it will get you to fulfillment much more reliably than any other way.

Search for strategies that fit you strengths is like searching for the steepest slope. Get better at the things you care about most

### The Future of the US as we know it

Vibrant communities based on micro-motives will become the norm. People will begin to bond and build communities based on those little triggers that make you tick. Groups of people who have a similar profession, sure, but the bond will be over the specific way in which these groups get fulfillment from their work.

Democratic meritocracy will hopefully become the norm. We don't live in a meritocracy, as much as people think we do. There are still the aristocratic seats saved for those to go to premier institutions and get premier jobs etc. The democratic meritocracy seeks to truly go to a system where everyone gets their basic needs fulfilled, and then the remainder of your value to society is decided by you, your strengths, and your output of value to society. Democratic meritocracy can only function properly if you are willing to view your pursuit of fulfillment as a duty you owe to society. If we all seek fulfillment (*not money, titles, fame)*, we will have a world where there's a positive feedback loop of everyone helping each other be the most fulfilled version of themselves. The issue with today is that we participate in what is nicely referred to as the rat race. Ultimately the rats serve one purpose and that's about it. We as humans can change that, become valued for our multi-dimensionality. Imagine a life where you're serving your calling with utmost purpose- do you think you'll be more apt to help others achieve fulfillment too? This positive feedback loop is less transactional and will only serve to help our society.

Seeking happiness: happiness is the favorable state of fitting one's circumstances. That's why happiness doesn't exist at a certain job title or salary, especially if what you're doing everyday to hold on to that title or salary isn't particularly fulfilling to you. Jefferson believed in the existence of positive feedback loop between individual pursuit of happiness/fulfillment and the collective fulfillment of all members of society. Your pursuits elevate your neighbors and vice-versa. 

Society must oblige its institutions to provide for the individual pursuit of fulfillment by all citizens while simultaneously obliging its citizens to pursue fulfillment. In this society, only one assumption must hold in order for this to be successful: that anyone who achieves personal fulfillment will feel a natural obligation to give back to society that supported his or her right to pursue fulfillment.
